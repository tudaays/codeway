# codeway
## The meaning of the codeway repo
Codeway, as its name, is the definition, the construction of my own way to learn to code. Some may call it the foundation, but I think **way** is appropriate. 

## What's in it anyway?
Examples, algorithms, multiple languages foundation etc. can be found here. Some may call it a *dump* but I don't think so. Instead I find peace inside chaotic pieces like this.
